HealthMasters is a webgame about how to maintain a healthy lifestyle for kids. Featuring three different activities, HealthMasters engages youth through interactive elements such as fun buttons, images, and trivia questions:

-This or That: This minigame guides the user in building their own nutritious meal based on descriptions of each category (fruits, veggies, dairy, etc.)

-My Clean Environment: The user will "pick up" different objects around the room that should not be there by clicking on them, learning why it's important to have a clean living space in the process.

-Did You Know?: Inspired by the format of online quizzes, this game asks basic questions on various health topics, counting up the total correct answers at the end.
